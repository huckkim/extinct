# Extinctathon
 Monitored by MaddAddam. Adam named the living animals, MaddAddam names the dead ones.

For my media project I decided to implement a small game version of Extinctathon.

## Features 
- User logins
- Animal Status search
- "Hacking" game

### User Logins
The website is initally very plain and has little to no features. To access them you need to login through the login button. Here you are asked for a username and password. When trying to sign up you are met with a 404, this is because there is no reason to accept new members anymore.
Since this is the most basic level I choose basic passwords that could have been easily guessed.  
**User:** crake  
**Password:** oryx  
After submitting this redirects you to the homepage. However, now we can see that the page has changed a little and there are more options to click on.  

### Animal Status search
Now in the middle of the homepage you can find a form where you can search up an animal. If it recognized there will be a status given. Only certain animals are registered in the database. I used some of the animals found in the book that used to be the MaddAddam grandmaster usernames.  

#### Some registered animals
- Carex albida _or_ White Sedge
- Diceros bicornis _or_ 
- Ursus maritimus _or_ 
- Panthera tigris _or_ 
- Picidae _or_ 

### "Hacking" Game
This was where the majority of the time was spent coding. In the book we see Crake casually hacking his way through website to get access to different things. I tried to emulate that by making a "hack" puzzle where the user needs to use the terminal to get a flag or secret key.
