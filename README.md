 Monitored by MaddAddam. Adam named the living animals, MaddAddam names the dead ones.

For my media project I decided to implement a small game version of Extinctathon.

##Features 
-User logins
-Animal Status search
-"Hacking" game

### User Logins
The website is initally very plain and has little to no features. To access them you need to login through the login button. Here you are asked for a username and password. When trying to sign up you are met with a 404, this is because there is no reason to accept new members anymore.
Since this is the most basic level I choose basic passwords that could have been easily guessed.
**User:** crake
**Password:** oryx
After submitting this redirects you to the homepage. However, now we can see that the page has changed a little and there are more options to click on.

### Animal Status search

### "Hacking" Game
